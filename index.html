      <h2>👨‍💻 My Journey So Far</h2>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Pawan — a versatile Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack, with a solid foundation in both technology and business operations. With hands-on experience from internships and my previous roles, I’ve built scalable and responsive web applications using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
  <br><br>

  I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle — from crafting clean, intuitive user interfaces to developing secure APIs and managing data workflows. My current focus is on building self-driven, real-world projects that demonstrate my technical capabilities and problem-solving approach. I'm consistently upskilling to align myself with modern development standards, aiming to grow alongside a forward-thinking team where I can contribute meaningfully and evolve with the organization.
  <br><br>

  My journey into tech wasn’t just academic — it was shaped by real-world exposure in the automotive industry where I worked with enterprise tools like Siebel CRM, Tally ERP, and CompuTax. These tools introduced me to structured business systems and inspired me to transition into full-stack web development. That background helps me approach development not just from a technical perspective, but also with a clear understanding of user needs and operational flow.
  <br><br>

  Whether it's managing services through Siebel CRM, handling billing via Tally ERP, or creating dynamic interfaces using React — I bridge the gap between business logic and modern development. I'm currently working on building production-ready self-projects like <strong>“just-download”</strong>, which I started as a Python-based desktop app and later extended into a mobile and web version, along with a Chrome extension. This will also be deployed under my main portfolio using GitHub Pages.
  <br><br>

  Along the way, I explored deployment tools like Docker for smooth environments, configured Cloudflare for domains, subdomains, and custom email, and understood domain buying strategies by comparing multiple providers before choosing Spaceship. These things helped me learn real-world deployment and decision-making skills.
  <br><br>

  I’ve also polished my older GitHub repos to refresh concepts and maximize practical value, while integrating AI tools to speed up and improve workflows. All of this has helped me improve not only technically, but also as a disciplined learner and thinker.
  <br><br>

  Although I’ve started building with focus and consistency, I still consider myself a fresher in the tech industry — ready to learn and contribute. I'm looking for a team and a mentor who believes in collaboration, experimentation, and growth — both personal and professional.
  <br><br>

  🚀 Let’s connect and build something valuable together.
